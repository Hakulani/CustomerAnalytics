# Sanity Check

## Sales Transaction

### Missing Value 
The dataset consists of a total of 2,406,316 rows. Columns such as `total_amt`, `product_json`, `discount`, and `paid_amt` contain null values.

**Clean Data Action**: Remove rows with null values in columns `total_amt` and `product_json`.

### Incomplete Dataset 
Upon reviewing the sales transaction tables, it's evident that data from Y2021 for the months M6 â€“ M12 is missing.

**Clean Data Action**: Exclude data from Y2021 when preparing the dataset for model development.

### Special Data Characteristic 
The `product_json` column has a special format. It contains data in json format detailing the products and the quantity purchased in each transaction.

**Clean Data Action**: Parse this column to represent each product in its own column alongside the respective quantity.

### Incorrect Format 
The `payment_date` column contains data that is not in the correct date format.

**Clean Data Action**: Convert the data in this column to a proper date-time format.

### Lack of Essential Data 
The dataset lacks crucial information like the price per product and details about customer membership.

**Clean Data Action**: (You need to specify what action to be taken here.)

# Assumption

- Focus will be on the total amount rather than the paid amount. It's observed that only 50K members paid more than zero from a total of 578K members.
- Recommendations will be based on the data from the most recent two months in 2023 for products in each cluster.

## Feature Selection for Customer Segmentation:

1. **Total Amount**: Cumulative spending of each customer.
2. **Total Quantity**: Overall number of items purchased by each customer.
3. **Frequency**: Count of transactions made by each customer.
4. **Visit Period**: Duration between the first and last transaction dates for each customer.
5. **Mean Time Between Purchase**: Average time interval between successive purchases. It's calculated as the total time span from the start date to the last purchase date divided by the total number of transactions.
6. **Basket Size**: Represents the average spending for every item bought by a customer.
7. **Order Size**: Average spending for each order placed by a customer.
8. **Visit Size**: Average quantity of items bought in each transaction by a customer.
9. **CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value)**: Predicted net profit from a customer throughout their lifetime relationship with the business.
10. **Discount Amount**: Cumulative discount received by each customer.
11. **Visit Center**: Count of unique centers or locations visited by each customer.
12. **%Qty by Price Range**: Percentage distribution of items purchased by a customer across different price brackets. This feature provides insights into the customer's spending habits across various price ranges.
13. **Member**: Count of individuals or entities that are under the direct influence or referral of the customer (often referred to as downlines in a referral or MLM system).

These features provide a holistic view of customer behavior, spending patterns, and engagement with the business, making them crucial for effective segmentation.

# Random Forest Classification for Cluster Prediction
This project focuses on leveraging the power of the Random Forest algorithm to predict data clusters and analyze cluster movement over different time frames.
## Overview
Random Forest is a renowned ensemble learning technique that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees. By leveraging subsets of data observations and variables, the Random Forest model achieves enhanced accuracy and stability in its predictions.

In the context of this project, we've previously applied clustering to segment our data. The results from this clustering serve as input for our classification model. The overarching goal is to predict which cluster a new data point would belong to and to understand the migration or movement of these data points between clusters over time.

## Purpose

The main objectives of this project include:

1. **Predictive Cluster Analysis**: Utilize the Random Forest classifier to predict the cluster label for incoming or new data.
  
2. **Cluster Movement Analysis**: Analyze the transition of data points from one cluster to another over specific time intervals, providing insights into the evolving behavior and characteristics of the segmented groups.
