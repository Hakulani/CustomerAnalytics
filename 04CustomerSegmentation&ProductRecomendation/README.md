# Customer Segmentation

## Definition
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics and behaviors. By doing so, companies can better understand their customers' needs and tailor their marketing strategies to each specific group, resulting in more effective sales efforts. This targeted approach not only enhances customer engagement but also fosters increased loyalty and more meaningful interactions.

## Benefit
By segmenting customers, businesses can glean deeper insights into their audience, fine-tune their marketing and sales strategies, and pinpoint key customer segments that warrant further investment. Additionally, it assists in refining marketing techniques and creating effective action plans.
