# Project Customer Single View and Basic Customer Analytics

## Definition
**Customer Single View** is a comprehensive representation that consolidates diverse customer data points, such as personal details and sales transactions, into one unified profile.
Typically formulated within a **Customer Data Platform (CDP)**, this view streamlines all user information, making it readily accessible for teams across an organization to extract insights and conduct analyses.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Understanding**: Gain a deeper understanding of customer profiles, purchase behaviors, preferences, and more.
- **Strengthened Relationships**: Foster improved customer relations by ensuring cohesive and tailored interactions across various touchpoints and departments that resonate with customer needs.

## Case Study
Imagine a scenario where a supermarket wants to create a single customer view. They would integrate data from loyalty programs, point-of-sale systems, online shopping carts, feedback forms, and more. This consolidated view would then provide insights into a customer's preferred shopping time, frequently bought items, preferred payment method, and even responses to past promotions, enabling tailored marketing strategies and improved service delivery.

## Data Cleaning Process
### Checking and Cleaning Raw Data:
1. **Missing Value Inspection**: Discovered 578,082 rows with null values in columns such as `CUST_CODE`, `CUST_PRICE_SENSITIVITY`, and `CUST_LIFESTAGE`.
2. **Data Cleaning Strategy**: Rows with null values in the `CUST_CODE` column were removed to retain only member transactions.

## Discussion:
For the purpose of this analysis, we've concentrated solely on member data.
